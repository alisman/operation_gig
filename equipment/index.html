At 341 Westminster Rd, facing house, walk down path to the right of the house.  Go through gate.  Locked shed will be right in front of you.  The key is hidden to your left and is circled in picture at bottom.

Thanks for being willing to haul the wagon!  This probably goes without saying but making sure all the equipment is returned is absolutely essential to subsequent shows, so please take special care to make sure that following items are returned in the wagon:

PA system with power and speaker cables in the compartment at back of mixer.

Two mic stands.

Two mics inside bag.

Two mic cables.

OG sign.

Whiteboard with whiteboard marker for Venmo.
